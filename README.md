# Reap Challenge

## 1️⃣ Frontend Validation

### Login Page

My first validation was to try to understand which errors the API returned with an incorrect password, and I got a Bad Request. In my opinion, the most appropriate error name should be an Authentication error, with the aim of having a more concise explanation.

At another time, I received this unauthorized error from a different API, not the one that responded with Bad Request. I found it confusing. I didn’t understand the meaning of this, and if I were part of the project, I would want to investigate it further.

### Sign-Up Page

At first, it worked as expected. No API errors and the screen displayed what was expected.

But I didn't receive any email. 
I tried this with other temporary email sites and got the same flow. It could be an issue with the other sites.
